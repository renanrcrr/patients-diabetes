# machine learning model to predict diabetes

Python program to solve a complex biomedical problem involving data analysis. In this example, I will analyze a dataset of patients with diabetes and build a machine learning model to predict diabetes based on various features.

In this program, we are using a dataset of patients with diabetes, which includes various features like age, BMI, blood pressure, glucose level, etc. The goal is to predict whether a patient has diabetes (binary classification) based on these features.

The program performs the following steps:

- Loads the dataset from a given URL using Pandas.
- Splits the dataset into features (X) and target (y).
- Splits the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split() from scikit-learn.
- Initializes a Random Forest classifier (RandomForestClassifier) from scikit-learn.
- Trains the classifier on the training data using fit().
- Makes predictions on the test set using predict().
- Evaluates the model's performance by calculating accuracy and generating a classification report using accuracy_score() and classification_report() from scikit-learn.
- Prints the results.

The complexity of the problem and dataset might be higher, and additional steps like data cleaning, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation might be needed for a more robust analysis.
